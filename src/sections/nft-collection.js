                        With personalities like Nelson Mandela, Oprah, Stephen Hawking among a host of other notable figures who have made an impact on world history and society, this new collection from Danielle honours those who have inspired, innovated, and shaped human potential across eras.

                        Exquisite in detail and original in concept, Danielle effectively depicts the genius of these timeless personalities as she immortalises their greatness on the blockchain, turning them into paragonsâ€”sources of contemplation of what the future generations should aspire to be and achieve.

Eleven memorable personalities grace Danielle Weber's The Luminaries collection. Each Luminary offers 11 exquisite digital pieces, bringing it to 121 collectibles you wouldn't want to miss out on.  Each digital collectible acts as a raffle ticket to get a chance to win the original painting. Meanwhile, non-winning NFT holders are still eligible for print versions of the paintings. Holders will also receive access to Danielle's upcoming artist course and to her first-ever exhibition, 'A Night with Luminaries.'
