        description  : "Inspiring on and off-screen, Leonardo DiCaprio has been making waves in the Climate Change movement over the past years. The actor who has played a leading man and a hero in various movie projects had also proven to be a protagonist for the planet's welfare in real life, with his support for environmental causes stretching far back into 1998 where he founded Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, a non-profit organization whose purpose is to protect all wildlife across the globe. But unlike the sole hero in a critically-acclaimed drama, Leonardo is no lone wolf in the cause. He actively supports other environmental organizations, recognizing that the fight against global warming, takes a community—it takes everyone. And while DiCaprio has received notable praise for his efforts, he hardly does it for the proverbial pat on the shoulder. Indeed, Leonardo DiCaprio is an icon worthy of our admiration and appreciation.",

        description  : "With a genius that reshaped our view of how the world works, describing Albert Einstein as revolutionary would be an understatement. With a Nobel Prize to stand by his name, Einstein is not just a physicist trapped in his own conception of reality. Through his Theory of Relativity and his famous equation, E=mc2, he acknowledged the interconnectedness of everything, humbling many to think beyond the physical that grounds us into our own suppositions. Einstein's scientific imagination transcended the constraints of common dogma. He inspired the creativity of latter generations as his intellect dismantled the elusiveness of the scientific discipline—turning it into something we can fathom and relate to, but nonetheless marvel in awe.",

        description  : "Amidst the volatile political climate of 1960s America, the Civil Rights movement saw a beacon of hope through Martin Luther King Jr. Taking inspiration from his Christian upbringing and Mahatma Gandhi's nonviolent activism, King led peaceful protests in the South departing from the method of his forerunners, something that earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. His method disillusioned institutional racism in the US through consistent, day-after-day, insistence on its injustice. Despite being assaulted by mobs and attacked by law enforcement on numerous occasions, King soldiered on, steadfast on his principles. He truly changed the course of history by opening the gates of equality to people of colour. And while his life was ended by a gunshot, no bullet could ever end the clamour for fairness and justice for all that resonates up to this day.",

        description  : "Time might be a fickle concept that the common man is often subject to, leading him to either triumph or break. But none have been more fascinated in the concept of time than Theoretical Physicist and Cosmologist, Stephen Hawking. At the young age of 17, he exchanged his desire for Mathematics for Physics which saw fruition through his PhD at Oxford, unhampered by a diagnosis of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in 1963. He went on to be recognised for his ground-breaking discoveries on Black Holes which birthed a hard-hitting book entitled, \"A Brief History of Time\" in 1988. Despite not seeing any improvement in his health, Hawking's resilience pushed him into resuming studies in the origins of the universe and how quantum mechanics impacts its existence. In 2004, he announced that he resolved the Black Hole Paradox, further sustaining the rich discussion in the scientific community. And while he succumbed to death in 2018, Hawking's genius lived on, transcending the barriers of time. A true inspiration, Stephen Hawking allowed us to wonder again in the midst of an era obsessed with easy answers—and that is intellect that no Black Hole could ever render obsolete.",

        description  : "While computer technology has become commonplace, it still manages to catch us off-guard, rendering awe and an almost child-like wonder in us. More often than not, it causes us to dream—to become more than what we are, or perhaps, to become who we are supposed to be. And amongst the sea of minds who have opened the doors to our imaginations is Steve Jobs. Considered to be one of the most motivated and driven entrepreneurs of all time, he is seen as one of the prime movers of the computer revolution, co-founding the mammoth tech company, Apple. He later went on to become the Chairman and CEO of the company, gracing it with more innovative plans for the future. However, a heated power struggle compelled him to leave the firm in 1985, motivating him to build the computer platform development company, NeXT along with some Apple employees. Jobs furthered his reach by funding Lucasfilm's visual effects arm the following year. When this computer graphics division became Pixar, Jobs assumed the position of Chairman. He then went back to Apple in 1997 after its acquisition of NeXT. He became its CEO, effectively saving it from impending bankruptcy. He helped develop a new line of products through the \"Think different\" advertising campaign. This effort gave birth to the Apple Store, App Store, Mac, iPod, iPhone, iPad, iTunes, and the iTunes Store. Saying that Steve Jobs revolutionised the world through technology is an understatement. He did more than change the world; Steve Jobs changed lives by providing us with the knowledge that we can do more than what we are simply told.",

        description  : "Not just a pretty face to marvel at nor a beautiful figure to revere on a pedestal, British actress Audrey Hepburn is a humanitarian, an advocate for children's rights, and a prime mover for women in show business. Her filmography impresses with the various personas she had assumed onscreen, proving her versatility as an actress. A talent worthy of praise and emulation by both her contemporaries and fans, Audrey became the first actress to win an Oscar, Golden Globe and a BAFTA for a single performance. But knowing her worth exceeded what she can do in Tinseltown, Audrey, later on, devoted her time to UNICEF by becoming its Goodwill Ambassador who made more than 50 trips to serve UNICEF causes in different parts of the world. This brought her to communities where she witnessed the real struggles of the most vulnerable children. In light of her uncompromising principles and the actions that followed them, in December 1992, Audrey was given the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Such is a beauty that persists and transcends our corporal inventions. Indeed, Audrey Hepburn is an icon who would forever inspire and shape our conceptions of ourselves.",

        description  : "The name Mother Mary Teresa or simply, Mother Teresa, has become synonymous with charity, goodwill, and selflessness. Born Anjezë, she was inspired by the personal narratives of missionaries and their service in Bengal. She was so fascinated in fact that at the early age of 12 Mother Teresa was resolved to offering up herself to a religious life, something that solidified on August 15th 1928 during her pilgrimage to the shrine of the Black Madonna of Vitina-Letnice. Her resolve led her to establishing the Catholic religious congregation, Missionaries of Charity in 1951. The institution actively serves hundreds of countries with communities stricken by disease and poverty. It caters to individuals dying of the most debilitating of diseases like tuberculosis, leprosy, and HIV/AIDS and runs meal centres, mobile clinics, counselling programs, schools, and orphanages. While receiving accolades such as the 1962 Ramon Magsaysay Peace Prize and the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize, Mother Teresa knew that her purpose was not simply subject to awards and rewards. She cared for none of these. She knew that being able to alleviate the situation of the downtrodden and marginalized, being able to see them become more than what society has limited them to be, is the reward in itself. Even before being canonized on September 4th 2016, Mother Theresa had always been a living saint, one who never asked to be offered prayers or a pedestal built on her name. Indeed, Mother Teresa is a light in the darkness, sparking hope that would never falter even in the face of adversity",

Angelina Jolie is an accomplished actress who had assumed varying roles that tested her range and carved a place for her among those that shone bright in the business. But apart from her Academy and 3 Golden Globe Awards, she shines bright as a special envoy for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Through her post, she was able to visit over 30 countries helping the displaced and impacted by political conflict and natural calamities. Angelina also set up a wildlife reserve in Cambodia which later came to be known as the Maddox Jolie-Pitt Foundation (MJP) as it expanded to become Asia's first Millennium Village.\n\nBraving war-torn countries with only her principles guiding her as she navigates unfamiliar and dangerous terrain, Angelina reached out to countless refugees to help better their situation. And in this courage to face what few had dared to makes her truly one of the most powerful and influential people in the American entertainment industry, a power dowsed not in pride and vanity, but in love and relentless service to humanity.",

In 2013, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Obama. In this world soiled by politics and indifference, Oprah chose to cast a light instead of cursing the darkness.",
